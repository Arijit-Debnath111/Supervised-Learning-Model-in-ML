It include the basic Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models in Machine Learning
I have calculated the linear regression as well as logistic regression equation in jupyter notebook.
The linear regression model works on continuous variable.
For this we need to wrk on the expectation of y and x where y and x are depedent and independent variables.
